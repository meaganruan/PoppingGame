CISC 3630 Popping Game

Using Clickteam Fusion Free

Set the dimensions so the screen looks good in portrait mode on a phone.

Design a scene with a background and place at least 5 objects to "Pop". Can be a balloon, tresure chest, ghosts, windows, doors, etc. Something to "pop open"

Make will be at least 5 "Active Objects" in the program.

Place the objects in your scene, so they look natural on the background. Make an event for the Mouse/Keyboard so that when "A user clicks on an object" the object changes it's animation (or frame if you want) to pop and change. Such as a balloon can pop, a ghost can burst, etc. You can make it interesting to make something appear, like if the balloon pops, something is revealed. You can even have various frames to show a random by changing to a random value, if you like. When the object pops, make an appropriate sound.

Have an intro scene, with your name, title, and instructions, with a button to click to change the scene to the "Game". Have some music on that screen.

Have a restart button on the game scene, to retart the current scene. The game scene should have background music.

Build an HTML5 application. Go to GitHub Pages (or some free web hosting) and post the game there.
